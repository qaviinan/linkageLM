## Original Requirements

Create an LLM-Based Fuzzy Matching Agent: Python module for handling missing values in datasets using Record-linkage, Embedchain, and LLAMA 3 API

## Project Name

llm_fuzzy_matching_agent

## Product Goals

- Efficiently handle missing values in datasets
- Integrate seamlessly with existing data processing pipelines
- Leverage advanced LLM capabilities for improved accuracy

## User Stories

- As a data analyst, I want to automatically handle missing values to save time on data preprocessing.
- As a developer, I want the module to integrate easily with existing data processing systems.
- As a data scientist, I want to use advanced LLM capabilities to improve the accuracy of data matching.
- As a project manager, I want to ensure the solution is scalable for large datasets.
- As a user, I want clear documentation to understand how to implement the module.

## Competitive Analysis

- DataCleaner: Basic missing value handling, lacks LLM integration
- OpenRefine: Powerful data cleaning, no LLM support
- Trifacta: User-friendly interface, limited LLM capabilities
- Talend: Comprehensive data integration, no specific LLM features
- Pandas: Popular for data manipulation, requires manual handling of missing values
- Dedupe.io: Focused on deduplication, lacks advanced LLM features

## Requirement Analysis

The project requires developing a Python module that leverages LLMs for fuzzy matching and handling missing values. It should integrate with existing data processing tools and provide a user-friendly interface for data analysts and developers.

## Requirement Pool

- ['P0', 'Develop core functionality for handling missing values using LLMs']
- ['P0', 'Ensure seamless integration with existing data processing pipelines']
- ['P1', 'Create comprehensive documentation for users']
- ['P1', 'Implement a user-friendly interface for configuration']
- ['P2', 'Optimize performance for large datasets']

## UI Design draft

The UI will include a simple dashboard for configuring the module, with options to select datasets, choose matching parameters, and view results. The style will be clean and intuitive, focusing on ease of use.

## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on specific datasets to be used for testing and the expected scale of data processing.
